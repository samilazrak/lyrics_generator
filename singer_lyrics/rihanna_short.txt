"As I was walkin' down the road to Bethlehem one night
I looked up to the sky and there I saw a wondrous sight
A star was shining brighter than I'd ever seen before
And a host of angels sang to me, never heard a song so pure
They said don't be afraid, we bring good news to all the world
With great tidings of joy for every boy and every girl

[Chorus:]
A child is born
On this holy night
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
So come to see
Mary's sweet baby
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully
Oh yeah

As I went down into the town to see what I could see
Three mighty kings with golden rings came ridin' up to me
They said they seek the child who was born beneath the star
Of all the kings this one would be the mightiest by far
So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come
And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone

[Chorus:]
A child is born
On this holy night
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
So come to see
Mary's sweet baby
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully
Hallelujah (repeated)

So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come
And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone

[Chorus:]
A child is born
On this holy night
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
So come to see
Mary's sweet baby
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully
Oh yeah

"Some girls play the game
They all walk and talk
And they dress the same
Nothin' new to say
Don't they realize
That it's so easy to see
Right though there disguise
Makes me wonder why
When the whole worlds turnin' left
It's when I'm goin' right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside

Cause a girl like me
Is just a lil' different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never settles for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me

Possibility
Got me trippin'
Thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me
Still I need to know
Should I keep this feelin'
Or let it go
I can't wait no more
So now's the time
To speak your mind
And show me what you feel
So tell me if you
Want to take a chance
On something real

Cause a girl like me
Is just a lil' different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never settles for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me

Mirror mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the answer here tonight
Mirror mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the answer here tonight

When the whole world's turnin' left
It's when I'm going right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside

Cause a girl like me
Is just a lil' different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never settles for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me

"Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my finger
It seems like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king
My California king

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king

"On my roof (roof, roof, roof)
Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof (proof, proof, proof)
I'm torn apart and you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold case love (love, love)
And I let you reach me one more time
But that's enough

Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall
Truth was there all along
Tell me how did we miss it

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes
Couldn't see, no
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind you can keep
Release me now cause I did my time
Of this cold case love
My heart's no longer cold and confined
I've had enough

Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall
Truth was there all along
Tell me how did we miss it

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

We lost our way
Took this too far
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart
We've lost enough
Looking for a truth
That was here all along

Cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

We opened up a cold case love
It got the best of us
Now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love, love

"
"Ooh yeah
Yeah yea

When you stand so close to me
I'm feeling butterflies
Is this the way that it supposed to be
When I look into your eyes
All you have to do is say my name
Just a stutter more like butter
Since I met you boy my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this

[Chorus]
Boy you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking baby your the one
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy little thing called love)
A crazy little thing called love
Whoa ho yeah

My best friends tell me Rihanna
What's got into you
I say Rihanna I can't explain
These feelings I'm going through
Tell me girl it's not like you to fall this way
I try my best to wear a disguise
But it's written on my face

[Chorus]

Yeah
It's crazy It's amazing
It's the loving that you feeling
Put a tingle in your body every time you want a healing
Hey Rihanna
Baby girl for you missing the song yeah
So tell the DJ put the pon de replay
If you wanna
Come on my bajun baby
Let me take to Jamaica
And introduce you to the real thing
For the loving where you are
So baby your my number one my number two
So if its loving that you want
Baby you should make me your boo

[Chorus]

Don't understand the meaning
This means crazy baby
I try my best not to show
But you know its so crazy baby
Crazy little thing called love
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy little thing called love)
Whoa yea

"
"I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got the whole in love thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time it didn't mean a thing

[Chorus]
My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening
I stray from love, this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

Did it happen when we first kissed?
'Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart

[Chorus]

How did I get here with you, I'll never know?
I never meant to let it get so, personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken heart and I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry

This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

All my life

"
"[Verse 1]
I'm not concerned with people
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man (oh yea)
Cause they only want to know you, enroll you
Only for the things ya had
I just think its so sad

[Hook]
Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down

[Verse 2]
They keep evil thoughts in their hearts (what you don't know)
You can't let them knock your hustle
Not letting them know how much you struggle
They turn green with envy when your on top
And dem heart is full with strife
Their by gonna try to take your life

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
Don't be fooled you betta recognize
They not there for you
They don't care for you
Trust me 'cause I know its true
Ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down
Then they turn against you when your not around
Its just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity

[Hook]

No more gas in the red
Can't even get it started
Nothing heard, nothing said
Can't even speak about it
All my life on my head
Don't want to think about it
Feels like I'm going insane
Yeah

It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
It's too close for comfort

[Chorus]
Throw on your break lights
We're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Your mind is in Disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scaring you tonight
Your mind is in Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia
