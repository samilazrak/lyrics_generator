"As I was walkin' down the road to Bethlehem one night  
I looked up to the sky and there I saw a wondrous sight  
A star was shining brighter than I'd ever seen before  
And a host of angels sang to me, never heard a song so pure  
They said don't be afraid, we bring good news to all the world  
With great tidings of joy for every boy and every girl  
  
[Chorus:]  
A child is born  
On this holy night  
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright  
So come to see  
Mary's sweet baby  
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully  
So peacefully  
Oh yeah  
  
As I went down into the town to see what I could see  
Three mighty kings with golden rings came ridin' up to me  
They said they seek the child who was born beneath the star  
Of all the kings this one would be the mightiest by far  
So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come  
And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone  
  
[Chorus:]  
A child is born  
On this holy night  
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright  
So come to see  
Mary's sweet baby  
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully  
So peacefully  
Hallelujah (repeated)  
  
So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come  
And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone  
  
[Chorus:]  
A child is born  
On this holy night  
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright  
So come to see  
Mary's sweet baby  
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully  
So peacefully  
Oh yeah

"Some girls play the game  
They all walk and talk  
And they dress the same  
Nothin' new to say  
Don't they realize  
That it's so easy to see  
Right though there disguise  
Makes me wonder why  
When the whole worlds turnin' left  
It's when I'm goin' right  
I need someone to let me be  
Just who I am inside  
  
Cause a girl like me  
Is just a lil' different from all the rest  
And a girl likes me  
Never settles for second best  
Could it be a boy like you  
That would give me anything  
If I asked him to  
To take all my dreams  
And make them true  
Show me all the reasons that you  
Ought to be with a girl like me  
Just like me  
  
Possibility  
Got me trippin'  
Thinkin' of what could be  
Between you and me  
Still I need to know  
Should I keep this feelin'  
Or let it go  
I can't wait no more  
So now's the time  
To speak your mind  
And show me what you feel  
So tell me if you  
Want to take a chance  
On something real  
  
Cause a girl like me  
Is just a lil' different from all the rest  
And a girl likes me  
Never settles for second best  
Could it be a boy like you  
That would give me anything  
If I asked him to  
To take all my dreams  
And make them true  
Show me all the reasons that you  
Ought to be with a girl like me  
Just like me  
  
Mirror mirror on the wall  
Catch me now before I fall  
I wish I may, I wish I might  
Find the answer here tonight  
Mirror mirror on the wall  
Catch me now before I fall  
I wish I may, I wish I might  
Find the answer here tonight  
  
When the whole world's turnin' left  
It's when I'm going right

"Chest to chest  
Nose to nose  
Palm to palm  
We were always just that close  
Wrist to wrist  
Toe to toe  
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose  
So how come when I reach out my finger  
It feels like more than distance between us  
  
In this California king bed  
We're ten thousand miles apart  
I'll be California wishing on these stars  
For you're heart on me  
My California king  
  
Eye to eye  
Cheek to cheek  
Side by side  
You were sleeping next to me  
Arm in arm  
Dusk to dawn  
With the curtains drawn  
And a little last night on these sheets  
So how come when I reach out my finger  
It seems like more than distance between us  
  
In this California king bed  
We're ten thousand miles apart  
I'll be California wishing on these stars  
For you're heart on me  
My California king  
  
Just when I felt like giving up on us  
You turned around and gave me one last touch  
That made everything feel better  
And even then my eyes got wetter  
So confused wanna ask you if you love me  
But I don't wanna seem so weak  
Maybe I've been California dreaming  
  
In this California king bed  
We're ten thousand miles apart  
I'll be California wishing on these stars  
For you're heart on me  
My California king  
My California king  
  
In this California king bed  
We're ten thousand miles apart  
I'll be California wishing on these stars  
For you're heart on me  
My California king

"On my roof (roof, roof, roof)  
Dark and I'm burning a rose  
I don't need proof (proof, proof, proof)  
I'm torn apart and you know  
What you did to me was a crime  
Cold case love (love, love)  
And I let you reach me one more time  
But that's enough  
  
Your love was breaking the law  
But I needed a witness  
So wake me up when it's over  
It don't make any difference  
Will it ever be solved  
Or am I taking the fall  
Truth was there all along  
Tell me how did we miss it  
  
We opened up a cold case love  
And it got the best of us  
And now prints, pictures and white outlines  
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime  
Of a cold case love  
  
Should've investigated  
But love blinded eyes  
Couldn't see, no  
And then I tried to cage it  
But your love ain't the kind you can keep  
Release me now cause I did my time  
Of this cold case love  
My heart's no longer cold and confined  
I've had enough  
  
Your love was breaking the law  
But I needed a witness  
So wake me up when it's over  
It don't make any difference  
Will it ever be solved  
Or am I taking the fall  
Truth was there all along  
Tell me how did we miss it  
  
We opened up a cold case love  
And it got the best of us  
And now prints, pictures and white outlines  
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime  
Of a cold case love  
  
We lost our way  
Took this too far  
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart  
We've lost enough  
Looking for a truth  
That was here all along  
  
Cold case love  
And it got the best of us  
And now prints, pictures and white outlines  
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime  
Of a cold case love  
  
We opened up a cold case love  
It got the best of us  
Now prints, pictures and white outlines  
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime  
Of a cold case love, love

"Ooh yeah  
Yeah yea  
  
When you stand so close to me  
I'm feeling butterflies  
Is this the way that it supposed to be  
When I look into your eyes  
All you have to do is say my name  
Just a stutter more like butter  
Since I met you boy my whole worlds changed  
I can't hide this or deny this  
  
[Chorus]  
Boy you got me catching feelings  
Got me thinking baby your the one  
I didn't understand the reason  
That my heart was beating like a drum  
I didn't understand the meaning  
Then you opened up my eyes to  
A crazy little thing called love  
(A crazy little thing called love)  
A crazy little thing called love  
Whoa ho yeah  
  
My best friends tell me Rihanna  
What's got into you  
I say Rihanna I can't explain  
These feelings I'm going through  
Tell me girl it's not like you to fall this way  
I try my best to wear a disguise  
But it's written on my face  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah  
It's crazy It's amazing  
It's the loving that you feeling  
Put a tingle in your body every time you want a healing  
Hey Rihanna  
Baby girl for you missing the song yeah  
So tell the DJ put the pon de replay  
If you wanna  
Come on my bajun baby  
Let me take to Jamaica  
And introduce you to the real thing  
For the loving where you are  
So baby your my number one my number two  
So if its loving that you want  
Baby you should make me your boo  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't understand the meaning  
This means crazy baby  
I try my best not to show  
But you know its so crazy baby  
Crazy little thing called love  
A crazy little thing called love  
(A crazy little thing called love)  
Whoa yea

"
"I'm not the type to get my heart broken  
I'm not the type to get upset and cry  
'Cause I never leave my heart open  
Never hurts me to say goodbye  
Relationships don't get deep to me  
Never got the whole in love thing  
And someone can say they love me truly  
But at the time it didn't mean a thing  
  
[Chorus]  
My mind is gone, I'm spinning round  
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown  
I'm losing grip, what's happening  
I stray from love, this is how I feel  
This time was different  
Felt like, I was just a victim  
And it cut me like a knife  
When you walked out of my life  
Now I'm, in this condition  
And I've, got all the symptoms  
Of a girl with a broken heart  
But no matter what you'll never see me cry  
  
Did it happen when we first kissed?  
'Cause it's hurting me to let it go  
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time  
And I know that it's no more  
I should've never let you hold me baby  
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart  
I didn't give to you on purpose  
Can't figure out how you stole my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How did I get here with you, I'll never know?  
I never meant to let it get so, personal  
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you  
I'm broken heart and I can't let you know  
And I won't let it show  
You won't see me cry  
  
This time was different  
Felt like, I was just a victim  
And it cut me like a knife  
When you walked out of my life  
Now I'm, in this condition  
And I've, got all the symptoms  
Of a girl with a broken heart  
But no matter what you'll never see me cry  
  
This time was different  
Felt like, I was just a victim  
And it cut me like a knife  
When you walked out of my life  
Now I'm, in this condition  
And I've, got all the symptoms  
Of a girl with a broken heart  
But no matter what you'll never see me cry  
  
All my life

"[Verse 1]  
I'm not concerned with people  
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man (oh yea)  
Cause they only want to know you, enroll you  
Only for the things ya had  
I just think its so sad  
  
[Hook]  
Get dem haters out your circle  
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down  
See them try to mess to hurt you  
And work you  
Anything to bring ya down  
  
[Verse 2]  
They keep evil thoughts in their hearts (what you don't know)  
You can't let them knock your hustle  
Not letting them know how much you struggle  
They turn green with envy when your on top  
And dem heart is full with strife  
Their by gonna try to take your life  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Bridge]  
Ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies  
Don't be fooled you betta recognize  
They not there for you  
They don't care for you  
Trust me 'cause I know its true  
Ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down  
Then they turn against you when your not around  
Its just jealousy and dishonesty  
So hold on to your sanity

We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now we're face to face

Please don't stop the music  
  
Please don't stop the music, music, music  
  
Please don't stop the music, music, music

Please don't stop the music  
  
Please don't stop the music, music, music

"I feel like I'm a hopeless romantic  
I can't help falling in love  
I fiend for love  
I want it, I crave it  
I just can't get enough  
  
Take me away  
I wear my heart on my sleeve  
Always let love take the lead  
I may be a little naive, yeah  
  
You know I'm drunk on love  
Drunk on love  
Nothing can sober me up  
It's all that I need, yeah  
  
I've been let down  
But never been tainted  
So I stay thirsty for more  
No I won't hold back  
No drop is wasted  
I let love run its course  
  
Take me away  
I wear my heart on my sleeve  
Always let love take the lead  
I may be a little naive, yeah  
  
You know I'm drunk on love

Nothing can sober me up

Drunk, drunk on love  
Nothing can sober me up  
It's all that I need  
  
I'm so intoxicated  
I love the way you taste on my lips  
When we kiss  
You got me so addicted  
So much I can't resist  
Falling into your arms  
  
Take me away  
I wear my heart on my sleeve  
Always let love take the lead  
I may be a little naive, yeah  
  
You know I'm drunk on love  
Drunk on love  
Nothing can sober me up

And some reciepts here that say you went shoppin

Can't stand around cryin no more  
Got your bags packed sittin by the door  
Ima leave you heart broken on the floor  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
I'm standing by your bed  
And so tempted to pull out your iv  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
I'm fightin with myself  
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now  
Let me see you try to live without me  
Now wheres your heartbeat?  
Flat line on the E-K-G

Well I was home late at night watchin tv  
Got a call from my girl sayin Riri  
Saw your man in the club  
I thought he was out of town doin business  
Said that he'd be back in three weeks  
Now I'm mad (mad)  
Sittin in the kitchen gettin sad (sad)

"You say you love me  
Well they feel like words to me  
Well this just ain't working  
Stop thinking you can run over me  
I'm drifting, I'm settling  
Off to a foreign place  
If I can't see what's in front of me  
It's a mystery, well then apparently  
  
Things just ain't the same  
And I'm ready for change  
Go on, begone, bye bye, so long  
Can't you see that you're  
Fading, fading, fading, fa-a-a-a-away  
Away, away, away, away  
I opened up my eyes, and I finally realized  
Today, today, it's too late  
You're fading away  
  
Put a sock in it just stop running your mouth  
Got my mind made up, I ain't coming back again  
No way, no way, no way, no way  
'Cause I'm so fed up, boy you got me messed up  
If we hookin' back up, don't press your luck today, today  
I'm blowing you away

Go on, begone, tata so long  
Can't you see that you're  
Fading, fading, fading, fa-a-a-a-away  
Away, away, away, away  
I opened up my eyes, and I finally realized  
Today, today, it's too late  
You're fading away  
  
Saw you turn into a ghost right in front of my eyes  
Tell me what's a girl to do when she's crying inside?  
I'm about to go insane  
I'm jumping off this train  
Whether wrong or right, I'll be gone by night  
  
Can't you see that you're  
Fading, fading, fading, fa-a-a-a-away  
Away, away, away, away  
I opened up my eyes, and I finally realized  
Today, today, it's too late  
You're fading away

"Wherever you're going, I wanna go  
Wherever you're heading, can you let me know

Just can't take the thought of you miles away  
  
And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life  
I hope that you find it on the first try  
And even though it kills me that you have to go  
I know it will be sadder if you never hit the road  
  
So farewell  
Somebody's gonna miss you  
Farewell  
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here  
That somebody is me  
  
I will write to tell you what's going on  
But you won't miss nothing but the same old song  
If you don't mind catching up  
I'll spend the day telling you stories about a land far away  
But I know  
  
And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life  
I hope that you find it on the first try  
And even though it kills me that you have to go

Try to hold back my tears

"I never should of waited so long to say  
What I've always known since the very first day  
Thought that you would stay forever with me  
But the time has come to leave

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes  
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life  
Its you that I live for, and for you I die  
So I'll Lay here with you til the final goodbye  
  
Hold, draw me close, close to my lips  
Listen intently as I tell you this  
Outside the world wages its wars,  
I'll rest in peace as long as you know

Promise you our love will carry on  
Until you turn eternal, we belong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
His respectful lips for the last time  
And spell out the lyrics to love in the sky  
Its you that I live for and for you I die  
So I'll lay here with you till the final goodbye  
  
Goodbye

"Yeah  
Whoa  
Gunfire left a hole  
In the tank  
Losing gasoline  
  
Fire is on my trail  
And he's after me  
Hope it don't get here  
Before I get where I'm going  
I gotta get where I'm going  
Take off my mask to breath  
  
You could've been a apart of a  
Masterpiece  
Fluid in the breaks  
Was the last to leak  
That's the thing  
  
Where I'm going  
I don't need my breaks  
Can't wait to see your face  
When your front windows break  
And I come crashing through  
  
The lovers near to clear the road  
Oh, oh, oh  
'Cause this thing is ready to blow  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
I just wanna set you on fire  
So I wont have to burn alone  
Then you  
Then you'll know where  
I'm coming from  
Fire bomb  
Fire bomb  
  
Scenes go  
But baby no  
Doesn't have to be  
Microwaving a medal tragedy  
Watching it burn and  
Its beautiful and its blue  
And its pitiful  
When its through  
Its the other half of me  
  
I didn't do it  
You lit the match for me  
Now were flying  
From the blast, baby  
That's the thing  
  
Where were going  
We don't need no breaks  
Can't wait to see your face  
When your front windows break  
And I come crashing through  
  
The loveers near to clear the road  
Oh, oh, oh  
'Cause this thing is ready to blow  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
I just wanna set you on fire  
So I wont have to burn alone  
Then you  
Then you'll know where  
I'm coming from  
Fire bomb  
Fire bomb  
  
Baby we were killing them  
They couldn't handle the millionth degree  
We were criminals (ah ah ah)  
As we were burning  
The world called the police  
Fire department, ambulance  
You can call me crazy cause I believe  
The only move for me and you  
Is to blow our flames  
And  
  
The lovers need to clear the road  
Oh, oh, oh  
'Cause this thing is ready to blow  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
I just wanna set you on fire  
So I won't have to burn alone  
Then you  
Then you'll know where  
I'm coming from  
Fire bomb  
Oh, oh, oh  
Fire bomb

"[Verse 1: Rihanna]  
The new version is better to be the first half of the year and I love the fact  
I don't have the right way and it will take the bus driver just got invited  
Help me find a way to the gym today and it was the best thing about living
room  
Really fun to use the term of office of a sudden it was the best player  
I'm at a time when you are so much for a long way in hell of an eye out for me  
I just got to go home now I'm just like a baby I can be found at least a dozen  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Ne-Yo]  
With my time with you guys should have the right way and it will take the lead  
Isn't that the two sides to the gym today I am a big fan and the first half of
them  
To the first place for me I was the only way you want a boyfriend is so good  
Looking for me I was a little too hard and it will not have the right thing to
do  
  
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]  
Why are people in this country to get my money and time consuming but it  
It would have the right thing and the fact is the most recent version and the
fact  
I'm so tired and hungry for me and the first place I have no clue who I want  
The fact that you are so much for a long way in hell is going on with a few
years  
And it will not have the right way too long for a few years and it will take
place  
  
[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]  
I give you my love life in a while and the other side is a trademark
infringement  
I'm at the same thing as the most beautiful thing is just like easy for first
place  
I don't think that the first place I don't have the right way too long for a
freshman  
I'm so tired but can't be a little more time with you on my iPhone to become  
The first place in my room for a few weeks and I'm so excited about it will
not

[Bridge: Ne-Yo]  
For the first place I want a relationship is the only thing I would have  
It will take place in the morning to the point of view and it will not let the
bed  
I'm at work on a Friday afternoon at a time when the sun goes on the low price  
  
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]  
Why are people in this country to get my money and time consuming but it

"Mama, I found a man  
Who loves me and understands  
Papa, he's quite a man  
He adores me, he's my biggest fan  
And don't get me wrong,  
I know he's not perfect in your eyes  
But somehow he's flawless in mine  
  
And you may tell me to run, run now  
But I can't do that  
We're too far down the hole  
He's got a hold on my soul  
  
So I guess I'm a fool  
I'm a fool in love  
But I'm willing to stay here  
And bask in the glory of his heart  
I guess I'm a fool in love  
But I'm willing to look so stupid  
Till I had enough  
  
Mama, don't judge me now  
I'm not trying to hurt you  
I know this won't make you proud  
Papa, did I let you down?  
Are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?  
  
You'll see a monster  
I see a smile  
You say it's danger  
And I'm in denial  
But somehow I feel so safe right now  
  
So I guess I'm a fool  
I'm a fool in love  
But I'm willing to stay here  
And bask in the glory of his heart  
I guess I'm a fool in love  
But I'm willing to look so stupid  
Till I had enough

"Is there another guy?  
Who I think is cool,  
Walking outside my door,  
Peeking everyday.  
  
I look at him,  
Like he is so poor,  
Everytime I eat he will steal,  
He is my boy.  
  
There are four Evermore,  
Radio stations,  
Everywhere that we go.  
You think I know,  
He is so cute.  
He is cool and funkin'.  
In the four Evermore.  
  
Is there someone?  
That I look onto,  
Kiss me on my cheek,  
Taking advantage.  
  
I look at him,  
Like he is so poor,  
Everytime I eat he will steal,  
He is my boy.  
  
There are four evermore,

Everywhere that we go.

We don't play that shit  
Nigga, we don't play, no  
  
Everybody quiet when you did your dirt  
Actin' like a bitch finna' get you hurt  
Break your life down to the knees, oh  
I got these girls like a soldier, trippin',  
It's going down, down, down  
I'm ready to roll  
Girl, I'm with you  
If they get you they get me  
So come on! Let's go!  
Bitch, I'm with you  
If he whip you he whip me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Girl, come on we ain't done yet  
Got a lot to handle  
We ain't take over the world yet  
Boom!  
We a army  
Better yet a navy  
Better yet crazy  
Guns in the air  
Guns in the air  
Guns in the air  
  
Can't hurt us again when you come around here  
We got our guns, got our guns, we got our guns, got our guns  
We got our guns in the motherfucking air, oh  
  
I'm down for life  
Gangsta for life  
I'm down for life  
Gangsta for life

I lick the gun when I'm done  
'Cause I know revenge is sweet

"You had me,  
You lost me,  
You'll never get the chance again,  
We broke up, You messed up,  
It all worked out in the end.  
I didn't know how to tell you,  
That I didn't wanna be yours,  
But you did it for me,  
You opened and shut the same door.  
Not gonna be your doormat,  
Not gonna linger,  
It just ain't like that,  
Don't you click your fingers,  
You said you didn't want me,  
You didn't wanna be my lover,  
Now you're changing the story,  
I'm afraid, man down, It's game over.  
Game over.  
  
You want me, You crave me,  
You're barking up the wrong tree,  
I'll shake you, Coz I won't take you,  
This is how it was meant to be.  
I didn't know how to tell you,  
I'm not in love anymore,  
Even though it was a mistake,  
Telling me to walk out the door,  
And now you're wanting me back,  
I won't comply, You text me saying \"I love you\",  
You know I won't reply.  
Not gonna be your doormat, Not gonna linger,  
It just ain't like that, So don't you click your fingers,  
  
You said you didn't want me,  
I'm not a pushover,  
Now you're changing the story,  
I'm afraid, man down, It's game over.  
Game over.  
You just can't expect me, To come running everytime,  
Because I'm happier the way I am,  
And I'm doing fine,  
I feel like your obsession,  
Like you want me day and night,  
You shouldn't have let me go, Or at least put up a fight. No, No no, Not  
Gonna run to you, No no.  
Your game's over. Not gonna be your doormat,  
Not gonna linger, It just ain't like that,  
Don't you click your fingers,  
You said you didn't want me,  
You didn't wanna be my lover,  
Now you're changing the story,  
I'm afraid, man down It's game over.  
It's game over, Oh no no,  
Game over, Now you're changing,  
The Story,  
Man down,  
It's game over

"Now this be the last time you did me wrong  
No more laying up in your arms  
No calling, saying you want me back  
I'm packing my bags, what you think about that?  
  
Stayed at home like a good girl do  
But Tonight baby you got me sad and blue  
I just heard about the girl in your car, y'all kissing at the bar  
Got me crying  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ohhh, you got me hatin' on the club  
'Cause you took my love  
Oh you took my love  
Now you got me like whoahhh  
You got me hatin' on the club  
'Cause you took my love  
Why'd you have to take my love  
Whoahh  
  
And you can be mad at me all you want  
I ain't coming in, I'll be waiting out front  
Coming out the door with your girlfriend  
You did me wrong boy tell me where our love went  
  
Stayed at home like a good girl do  
But Tonight baby you got me sad and blue  
I just heard about the girl in your car, y'all kissing at the bar  
Got me crying

Ohhh, you got me hatin' on the club  
'Cause you took my love  
Oh you took my love  
Now you got me like whoahhh  
You got me hatin' on the club  
'Cause you took my love  
Why'd you have to take my love  
Whoahh  
  
Now this is the sound of a broken heart  
There's only one reason why we're apart  
She never woulda made it to your car  
If it wasn't for the club, I'd still have my love  
We would still have us  
I'd still have my love  
We would still have us  
  
But now we're like whoahhhh  
  
Ohhh, you got me hatin' on the club  
'Cause you took my love  
Oh you took my love  
  
But now, now we're like whoahhh  
You got me hatin' on the club  
You took my love  
Oh you took my love

"
"The steps on the stairs  
Aren't really there  
Feel like there's someone watching me  
Shadows on the wall  
Whispers down the hall  
When I look there's nothing to see  
You say that you let her go  
Turn the page and closed the door  
Can't get inside your head  
'Cause when I try, she's there instead  
  
I can't compete with a memory  
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?  
There's two of us but it feels like three  
I wish her ghost would just let us be  
Boy you're everything I ever wanted  
But I got to let you go 'cause this love is  
Haunted  
Haunted  
  
You say that she's gone  
That you've moved on  
So why do I feel her eyes on me  
Invisible chains keep us in pain  
Won't you please tell her set you free?  
Sometimes when you look past me  
Your eyes see someone I can't see  
So I've given up this war  
'Cause I can't fight it anymore  
  
I can't compete with a memory  
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?  
There's two of us but it feels like three  
I wish her ghost would just let us be  
Boy you're everything I ever wanted  
But I got to let you go 'cause this love is  
Haunted  
Haunted  
  
Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave  
The walls are closing in it's so damn hard to breath  
There is nothing I could do about it  
  
I can't compete with a memory  
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?  
There's two of us but it feels like three  
I wish her ghost would just let us be  
Boy you're everything I ever wanted  
But I got to let you go 'cause this love is  
Haunted  
Haunted  
  
Haunted  
Haunted  
  
I don't want to fight anymore  
Someone's walking out that door  
  
Haunted  
Haunted

"It's been a minute since I saw you boy  
Like some medicine to hear your voice  
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when you're around  
See you haven't lost your sense of style  
And you still could melt me with your smile  
Can't deny that I still got these feelin' deep inside  
  
It's funny how things could change  
But still remain the same  
Isn't life just a crazy game  
Baby, here I go again  
  
[Chorus]  
I look into your eyes and then  
My heart remembers when  
And I realize I've never gotten over you  
Everytime I hear your name  
It's like the sunshine through the rain  
And I realize it's happenin'  
Baby, here I go again  
  
Here I go again  
  
Still remember how you make me weak  
How I fought to find the words to speak  
I just can't escape the memories  
I tried but I just can't break free  
But I closed the door on what we had  
But these feelings just keep comin' back  
Didn't think that you could make me lose control like that  
  
It's funny how things could change  
But still remain the same  
Isn't life just a crazy game  
Baby, here I go again  
  
Sweet lovin' is my ting  
So you know mi got fi swing  
That's why yuh request it again  
Without a doubt yuh want to spend  
And to experience it again  
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then  
So make me light it up again  
Reignite the flames again  
'Cause you really miss 'dem days when we used to chill  
Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Nigril  
Girl yuh Bajan beauty it a gimme di chill  
Not to mention the way you are within  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's funny how things could change  
But still remain the same  
Isn't life just a crazy game  
Baby, here I go again  
  
[Chorus]

"You left me down, with not a chance to fall  
My heart was on the line and I can't explain  
To everyone that I, that I fell so in love with you  
You left me waiting on the line  
  
Waiting for you  
That day was so difficult to cry myself to sleep  
I knew that you would wait for me, but I was wrong  
But I was wrong  
  
Why, leaving me tonight  
I pray it's only a while 'til she'll be back again  
No, it's only in my head, it's everything you said  
Tonight alone again, why  
  
You came, the days grew dim for me  
I knew we would be, but I thought we would see it out  
For what we had was stronger than the things they knew  
We knew  
  
Why, leaving me tonight  
I pray it's only a while 'til she'll be back again  
No, it's only in my head, it's everything you said  
Tonight alone again  
  
Righteous, righteous  
Leaving me tonight  
Righteous, righteous  
Don't leave me  
No, don't go tonight  
  
You'll see me walking away, I see you wanting to say  
I pray that you would see me for me, don't walk away  
  
And I will know that you are so true  
To all that I am, finding you  
  
And I want to get right, 'cause I don't walk around  
And I want to see tonight, and I know your sound  
It's like I've got to know, and I don't walk around  
If I could only get right, this time I know I could  
  
Why, leaving me tonight  
I know it's only a while 'til she'll be back again  
No, it's only in my head, it's everything you said  
Tonight alone again, why  
  
Righteous, righteous  
Leaving me tonight  
Righteous, righteous  
Don't leave me tonight  
  
Right, right, right  
Righteous now, we pray

"Baby, baby  
I found you one day.  
Lonely, bored, going nowhere.  
You were at a bar.  
Drinking from a far.  
And looking off into space.  
  
I came up to you.  
Asked you, how do you do.  
And we struck up a conversation.  
It turned real personal.  
And with me, became a sensation.  
  
Baby, baby  
I found in you.  
Something oh so true.  
I knew at the time.  
I wanted you as mine.  
I asked you to date.  
And you said that would be oh so great.  
From there we went somewhere.  
And love was in the air.  
  
Baby, baby  
Over time,  
You grew to be mine.  
I did not want to lose you.  
I did not want to screw you.  
I found in you a love so true.  
I want to keep it forever.  
You and me always together.  
  
Baby, baby  
One day after some time.  
I would ask you a most precious line.  
I asked you to marry me.  
You said, I agree.  
And together, we went off to be married.  
  
Baby, baby  
In you I found a love oh so true.  
It is pure, and white.  
Something true in my heart.  
In you all my dreams come alive.  
You give me joy, euphoria, and vibe.  
With you, I gave my heart all the way.  
For you baby, love is the only way.  
  
Love is the only way.  
Love is the only way.  
Love is the only way.  
Believe it true, baby.  
It is true everyday.

"On the first page of our story  
The future seemed so bright,  
Then this thing turned out so evil  
I don't know why I'm still surprised  
Even angels have their wicked schemes  
And you take that to new extremes  
But you'll always be my hero  
Even though you've lost your mind  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts.  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie.  
I love the way you lie  
Ohhh, I love the way you lie  
  
[Rihanna's Part 2]  
Now there's gravel in our voices  
Glass is shattered from the fight  
And this tug of war, you'll always win  
Even when I'm right.  
'Cause you feed me fables from your head  
With violent words and empty threats  
And it's sick that all these battles  
Are what keeps me satisfied  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie!  
Ohhh, I love the way you lie  
  
[Rihanna's Part 3]  
So maybe I'm a masochist  
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave  
Til the walls are goin' up  
In smoke with all our memories  
  
[Eminem's Part]  
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face  
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction  
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry  
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night  
So I can push you off me  
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me  
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy  
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me  
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me  
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the  
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we  
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs  
That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky  
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,  
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'?  
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count  
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain  
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counsellin'  
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand  
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it  
With you I'm in my f-ckin' mind, without you, I'm out it  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because  
I love the way you lie!  
I love the way you lie!  
I love the way you lie!  
I love the way you lie!  
I love the way you lie!

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you Lie  
  
Boy:  
  
I'm going crazy, just another lie baby  
I don't know what to do with this hate and  
Every time I look in your eyes they're telling me lies and I don't know what
to do  
Only want the truth, but I  
Know that I will never get, the love that I had if knew what you were doing
wrong  
Cause this love never felt so strong, but at the same time it feels so weak oh  
  
You know that you're hurting me, baby can't you see  
That your love is all I need, that your love is all I feel  
But I wonder is it still that real  
And every time that I put a smile on my face  
It's because I don't wanna loose you,  
It's because I know it will kill you  
I look into the mirror and say  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you Lie  
  
J-Me:  
  
So I, open up my eyes, open up this healing, that I've been feeling  
Don't know where it's taking me, don't know if it's you or me oho  
So I, just cried a river of emotions deeper then the ocean  
Baby cause I know that I never wanna go  
Never wanna leave your side  
  
I love the way you lie when you do it,  
Makes me wanna puke and get sick of the things that you're making up  
And I'm so caught up in this love song,  
Do you really know what I long for  
I'm addicted to you, yes it is true  
Baby cause I want you to stay  
I hurt myself every day  
I look into the mirror and say  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you Lie

Oh gosh, What ever happened to me  
Ever happened to me, ever happened to me?  
Why did I pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull the trigger? Boom  
And end a nigga, end a nigga life so soon?  
When mi pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull it pon' you  
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do? Ehh  
  
Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum  
Me say one man down (And wah me say)  
Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum  
Then me went downtown  
  
'Cause now I'mma criminal, criminal, criminal  
Oh lorda mercy, now I am a criminal  
Man Down, tell the judge please gimme minimal  
Run out a town none a dem can see me now  
  
Oh mama, mama, mama

In central station  
In front of a big ol crowd  
Oh, why? Oh, why?  
Oh mama, mama, mama  
I just shot a man down  
In central station

"Here we lay face to face once again  
Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend  
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know  
We're just holding on to \"could have been\"s and we should be letting go  
  
[Chorus]  
It feels like you're a million miles away as you're lying here with me tonight  
I can't even find the words to say I can find a way to make it right  
And we both know that the story's ending  
We play the part but we're just pretending and I can't hide the tears  
Cause even though you're here  
It feels like you're a million miles away  
  
Was it me, or was it you that broke away?  
For what we were is like a season love is change  
And every time I think about it, it tears me up inside  
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We can try to talk it over but we walked that road before  
While our song is playing its last note  
We both know for sure that it's time to close that door  
  
[Chorus]

"
"When the light shines down  
And time goes slowly  
When my mind's in the dust  
Spoilt and dying  
  
There's a pain in my hand  
Inscribed to the sad and lonely  
I've been so cold and alone thinkin' how long  
  
Now if you had told me, she would come back  
And if you had told me, the clock was gonna fall  
If you had shown me, some affection  
I would have believed you  
  
Don't tell me the moon is blue  
Cos tonight it's over, now the pain's in the dust  
And you can't find your blue moon  
It's over, ooh tonight it's over  
  
And yeah you been bad  
So why did I still want you to hold me?  
My tears of broken glass thinkin' ho wlong  
  
The blade was a sharp one  
That cut me both ways and tore my world apart  
Now I could have healed that wound so deep  
But you wouldn't understand  
  
Don't tell me the moon is blue,  
Cos tonight it's over, now the pain's in the dust  
And you can't find your blue moon  
It's over, ooh tonight it's over  
  
Don't you know that you hurt me so? You!  
  
Don't tell me the moon is blue, cos tonight it's over  
Now the pain's in the dust  
And you can't find your blue moon  
It's over, ooh tonight it's over

I was good on my own, that's the way it was, that's the way it was  
You was good on the low for a faded fuck, on some faded love  
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?

You was just another nigga on the hit list  
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch  
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage  
Fuck your white horse and a carriage  
Bet you never could imagine  
Never told you you could have it

You needed me  
Oooh, you needed me  
To feel a little more, and give a little less  
Know you hate to confess  
But baby ooo, you needed me

Lost in the mirror  
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear  
And I can't feel my body now  
I'm separate from here and now  
A drug and a drink  
We lost connection, oh come back to me  
So I can feel alive again  
Soul and body try to mend  
  
[Chorus]  
It's pulling me apart, this time  
Everything is never ending  
Slipped into a peril that I'll never understand  
This feeling always gets away  
Wishing I could hold on longer  
It doesn't have to feel so strange  
To be in love again  
To be in love again  
To be in love again

Like a bullet your love me hit me to core  
I was flying til you knocked me to the floor

Numb numb numb, he's so cold he doesn't feel a thing  
  
Broken heart was the case  
Wanna put him away  
He's the only one one one I ever let get the best of me

"Take a breath, take it deep  
Calm yourself, he says to me  
If you play, you play for keeps  
Take the gun, and count to three  
I'm sweating now, I'm moving slow  
No time to think, my turn to go  
  
And you can see my heart, beating,  
You can see it through my chest  
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no  
I know that I must pass this test  
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger)  
  
Say a prayer, to yourself  
He says, close your eyes  
Sometimes it helps  
And then I get, a scary thought  
That he's here, means he's never lost  
  
And you can see my heart, beating,  
Now you can see it through my chest  
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving  
I know that I must pass this test  
So just pull the trigger  
  
As my life flashes before my eyes  
I'm wondering will I, ever see another sunrise?  
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye  
But it's too late to think of the value of my life  
  
And you can see my heart, beating,  
Now you can see it through my chest  
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no!  
I know that I must pass this test  
And you can see my heart, beating,  
Oh you can see it through my chest  
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no!  
I know that I must pass this test  
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger)

"Baby boy what you done to me  
I saw you smiling suddenly  
I can't get you out my mind  
I got it bad boy I can't lie  
I want your time and your full attention  
I wanna to talk to you  
And not to mention good love that you give to me  
I think about it constantly  
No I won't apologize for feeling like I do  
It's just the simple facts of life  
I'm crazy over you

I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you  
Every minute of the day I'm addicted to what your giving me boy  
It's killing me when it comes to love  
I'm not trying share you  
Might think I'm greedy but I just don't care  
I need you in my world cause I'm a selfish girl  
  
I understand that you got your crew  
But I've got something in mind for you  
Make you lose all track of time  
Guaranteed to blow your mind  
I don't care what anybody got to say  
Maybe they never had it quite this way  
Let them talk and criticize  
They all need to recognize  
They might see I'm a bit extreme  
To need you night and day  
But what I feel can't be concealed  
There ain't no other way

Boy you got me tripping  
I didn't know what I was missing  
This is crazy (crazy)  
So amazing (so amazing)  
I didn't mean to be demanding but I hope your understanding  
I'm not playing boy (I'm not playing boy)  
I'm just saying boy  
They might see I'm a bit extreme  
To need you night and day

"Sell me candy like it's summer when it's melting in my hands  
I know you're around like the ice cream man  
I can hear you calling, whisper something in my ear  
You seem like sugar, tell me what I wanna hear  
I'm weak by your touch and when it's melting on my lips  
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips  
You're selling me your fantasy that I want to explore  
Sounds so good it's got me rockin' through the core

Talk to me  
Take in my dreams  
All I need

Sell me candy  
Sell me love  
Sell me hope  
Sell me doves

What's the cost?

You the boss  
  
Be a professional, boy, you make a sale  
I try to resist but every time I fail  
The one temptation that I gotta enjoy  
You're runnin' through my gun when you're knockin' at my door  
A thin little kiss, and your call is really sweet  
But the shawty that you're rockin' is nothing like me  
You're selling me a fantasy that I want to explore  
Sounds so good it's got me rockin' through the core (you know?)

I wanna play more than you know  
So don't you leave, and don't you go  
I want it all until time falls  
His arms I want to roam  
I want to love, give him my trust  
I want to live for both of us  
I want to breathe you, lay on your shoulder  
I want to warm you when nights get colder  
I want love, love, love  
I want love, love, love

"Overnight oh, Overnight oh  
  
Verse 1:  
I wish the pain would go away  
I wish they'd find a cure today  
I asked the doctor what it means  
He said \"Things ain't as bad as what they seem.\"  
My heart is working overtime to mend what's broke inside  
And it's hard for me to see the light  
Cause I'm stuck  
At least that's what it feels like  
  
I'm slower to heal  
Slower to heal  
Don't wanna feel the way I feel  
(Don't wanna feel)  
I wish I could kill this pain that I feel  
(Right away)  
But it don't happen that way, never  
  
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight  
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight  
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight  
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight  
So I'm slower to heal  
  
Verse 2:  
It's like I'm in a traffic jam  
(A traffic jam)  
Being pulled out of quicksand  
(Outta quicksand)  
It's like a newly planted tree  
I wish that you could find it in yourself to be patient with me  
  
I'm slower to heal  
Slower to heal  
Don't wanna feel the way I feel  
(Don't wanna feel)  
I wish I could kill this pain that I feel  
(Right away)  
But it don't happen that way, never  
  
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight  
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight  
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight  
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight  
  
I'm slower to heal  
Slower to heal  
Don't wanna feel the way I feel  
(Don't wanna feel)  
I wish I could kill this pain that I feel  
(Right away)  
But it don't happen that way, never  
  
I'm slower to heal  
Slower to heal  
Don't wanna feel the way I feel  
(Don't wanna feel)  
I wish I could kill this pain that I feel  
(Right away)  
But it don't happen that way, never  
  
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight  
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight  
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight  
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight  
  
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight  
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight  
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight  
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight  
So I'm slower to heal

"[Intro]  
Lalala lalala la la lala la Ohhh  
You know... I never felt like this before  
Lalala lalala la la lala la Ohhh  
Feels like... so real  
  
[Verse 1]  
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up  
And I'm aggressive just one thought of close enough  
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue  
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you  
I'm the question and you're of course the answer  
Just hold me close boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer  
You make me shaken up, never mistaken  
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help  
  
[Chorus:]  
S.O.S. please someone help me.  
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way  
Y.O.U. are making this hard,  
I can't take it, see it don't feel right  
S.O.S. please someone help me  
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way  
Y.O.U. are making this hard  
You got me tossin' and turnin' and can't sleep at night  
  
[Bridge:]  
This time please someone come and rescue me  
'Cause you on my mind it's got me losing it  
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me  
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it  
This time please someone come and rescue me  
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it  
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me,  
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it  
  
[Verse 2]  
Just your presence and I second guess my sanity  
Yes it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity  
My tummy's up in knots so when I see you I get so hot  
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock  
Take on me (uh huh) you know inside you feel it right  
[CD version:] Take me on I'm put desire up in your arms tonight  
[Video version:] Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight.  
I'm out with you, you got me head over heels  
Boy you keep me hanging on the way you make me feel  
  
[Chorus:]  
S.O.S. please someone help me.  
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way  
Y.O.U. are making (Y.O.U.) this hard,  
You got me tossin' and turnin' and can't sleep at night  
  
[Bridge:]  
This time please someone come and rescue me  
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it ('Cause you on my mind)  
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me  
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it  
This time please someone come and rescue me (someone come and rescue me)  
'Cause you on my mind got me losing it  
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me,  
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it  
  
Boy, you know you got me feeling open  
And boy, your loves enough with words unspoken  
I said boy I'm telling you, you got me open  
I don't know what to do it's true  
I'm going crazy over you,  
I'm begging  
  
[Chorus:]  
S.O.S. please somebody help me.  
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way  
Y.O.U. are making this hard (are you making this hard for me, baby?),  
You got me tossin' and turnin' and can't sleep at night  
  
[Bridge:]  
This time please someone come and rescue me (someone rescue me)  
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it  
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me  
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it  
This time please someone come and rescue me  
'Cause you on my mind got me losing it ('cause any time)

"All along it was a fever  
A cold sweat, hot headed believer  
I threw my hands in the air I said show me something  
He said, if you dare come a little closer  
  
Round and around and around and around we go  
Oh now tell me, now tell me, now tell me now you know  
  
Not really sure how to feel about it  
Something in the way you move  
Makes me feel like I can't live without you  
It takes me all the way  
I want you to stay  
  
It's not much of a life you're living  
It's not just something you take, it's given  
Round and around, and around, and around we go  
Oh now tell me, now tell me, now tell me, now you know  
  
Not really sure how to feel about it  
Something in the way you move  
Makes me feel like I can't live without you  
It takes me all the way  
I want you to stay  
  
Oh the reason I hold on  
Oh 'cause I need this hole gone  
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving  
'Cause when you never see the light, it's hard to know which one of us is
caving  
  
Not really sure how to feel about it  
Something in the way you move  
Makes me feel like I can't live without you  
It takes me all the way  
I want you to stay, stay  
I want you to stay, oh

"Mm  
Stupid in love  
Oh  
Stupid in love  
Hm  
  
Let me tell you something  
Never have I ever been a size ten in my whole life  
I left the engine running  
I just came to see  
What you would do if I gave you a chance to make things right  
So made it, even though Katie told me that this will be nothing but  
A waste of time  
And she was right  
Um,  
Don't understand it but it's blood on your hands  
Is still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies  
And I just don't know why  
Oh  
  
This is stupid  
I'm not stupid  
Don't talk to me  
Like I'm stupid  
I still love you but  
I just can't do this  
I maybe dumb but  
I'm not stupid  
  
My new nickname is you idiot (such an idiot) um  
That's what my friends are calling me  
When they see me I lean'n to my phone  
They're telling me let go  
He is not the one  
I thought I saw your potential  
I guess that's what made me dumb  
  
He don't want it.  
Not like you want it  
Scheming and cheating  
Oh girl why do you waste your time  
You know he ain't right  
They're telling me this  
I don't wanna listen but you insist  
On repeatedly trying to tell me lies  
And I just don't know why  
  
This is stupid  
I'm not stupid  
Don't talk to me  
Like I'm stupid  
I still love you but  
I just can't do this  
I maybe dumb but  
I'm not stupid  
  
Trying to make this work  
But you act like a jerk  
Silly of me to keep holding on  
Oh  
But the dunst cap is off  
You don't know what you've lost  
And you won't realize till  
I'm gone, gone, gone  
That I was the one  
Which one of us is really dumb  
  
Oh  
No  
No, I'm not stupid in love  
  
This is stupid (no no no)  
I'm not stupid (no no no)  
Don't talk to me  
Like I'm stupid (like I'm stupid)  
I still love you but  
I just can't do this (I just can't do this but)  
I maybe dumb but  
I'm not stupid  
  
I'm maybe dumb but I'm not stupid in love

"How 'bout a round of applause?  
Standin' ovation  
Oh  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
You look so dumb right now  
Standin' outside my house  
Tryin' to apologize  
You're so ugly when you cry  
(Please)  
Just cut it out  
  
Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not  
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught  
  
[Chorus]  
But you put on quite a show  
You really had me goin'  
But now it's time to go  
Curtains finally closin'  
That was quite a show  
Very entertaining  
But it's over now  
Go on and take a bow  
  
Grab your clothes and get gone  
(You better hurry up)  
Before the sprinklers come on  
Talkin' 'bout \"Girl, I love you you're the one\"  
This just looks like a re-run  
(Please)  
What else is on?  
  
And don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not  
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And the award for the best liar goes to you  
For makin' me believe  
That you could be  
Faithful to me  
Let's hear your speech out  
Oh  
  
How 'bout a round of applause?  
Standin' ovation

But it's over now

Million dollar voice, came through the phone  
We heading to the top, if you coming, come on

Fly down to Jamaica, just to roll some reefa  
Sex on the beach, left love speechless

"Te amo, te amo, she say's to me.  
I hear the pain in her voice.  
Then we danced underneath the candelabra, she takes the lead.  
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over.  
  
Then she said Te amo, then she put her hand around my waist.  
I told her no, she cried Te amo,  
I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go.  
My soul is awry and without asking why.  
I said Te amo, wish somebody would tell me what she said.  
Don't it mean I love you.  
I think it means I love you.  
Don't it mean I love you.  
  
Te amo, te amo, she's scared to breathe.  
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uhh.  
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water, I start to leave.  
She's begging me and asking why it's over.  
  
Then she said Te amo, then she put her hand around my waist.  
I told her no, she cried Te amo,  
I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go.

I said Te amo, wish somebody would tell me what she said.  
Don't it mean I love you.  
I think it means I love you.  
Don't it mean I love you.  
  
Yes we can dance.  
But you gotta watch your hands.  
Watch me all night.  
I move under the light because I understand.  
That we all need love, and I'm not afraid.  
I feel the love but I don't feel that way.  
  
Then she said Te amo, then she put her hand around my waist.

Staring down at the end again

On the road that's heading away from all your complaining

It's time to turn on the last song  
Ooh  
The last song  
Ooh  
  
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared  
And the sad song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear  
It was ours  
But I'd do it again, holding hands with my friend again  
But then again, maybe we gave our all a song we'll never forget  
Maybe let 'em play it maybe it'll save the world  
They gonna miss her when it's gone  
  
But it's time to turn (on) up the last song  
Ooh  
The last song  
Ooh  
  
What if we left every moment that we could spare  
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear  
You'll never know when the songs gonna play  
The last song you'll hear is the one you made  
This song was beautiful that's why I started singing it  
But this song is our song is playing until the end, even if its the last song  
  
The last song

"Once was a time you and I  
Made a promise till the day we die  
I trusted each and every word  
Never thinkin' that I'd get burned

Boy I thought that I knew you so very well  
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried  
And it cuts like a knife  
  
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips  
Or ever will deceive these eyes

There's no time  
To give it one more try  
There's only time to say goodbye  
  
Fooled me once shame on you  
Fooled me twice now this song is through  
The things you said I can never forget  
The things you did for my heart went through bad  
But I'm still standin' tall as I walk away  
And you know that it's true when you hear me say  
It's over, it's through  
Ain't nothin' you can do boy it's sad but it's true

"Gotta keep it on the down low  
I'll never let my momma know  
Only call him on my cellphone  
Only see him after dark  
  
I met him on the six train  
Just the way he said my name  
The brother had a lot of game  
Had me opened from the start  
  
He scoops me up in his ride  
Friday about a quarter to nine  
So fly and so fun  
And I'm so glad that he's all mine  
  
There's a thug in my life  
How am I goin' tell my momma  
She's gonna say it ain't right  
But he's so good to me  
  
There's a thug in my life  
And he's gonna cause crazy drama  
And when I see him tonight  
I'm gonna give him everything  
  
I know his crew's kinda shady  
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy  
But he's treating me like a lady  
Gives me everything I need  
  
I don't care whose hatin' on me  
'Cause every night he's waiting on me  
He's got mad personality  
A side you never see  
  
My friends tell me to slow down  
But every time that he's around  
My heart's on lock down  
Feel loved and I'm so proud  
  
There's a thug in my life  
How am I gon' tell my momma  
She's gonna say it ain't right  
But he's so good to me  
  
There's a thug in my life  
And he's gonna cause crazy drama  
And when I see him tonight  
I'm gonna give him everything  
  
Momma don't worry, I'm not in a hurry  
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry  
He's the one for me  
We'll be together, from now 'til forever  
I know it's the real thing, if you don't, whatever  
And I know it's meant to be  
  
There's a thug in my life  
How am I gon' tell my momma  
She's gonna say it ain't right  
But he's so good to me  
  
There's a thug in my life  
And he's gonna cause crazy drama  
And when I see him tonight  
I'm gonna give him everything

"[Chorus]  
Turn your face towards the sun  
Let the shadows fall behind you  
Don't look back, just carry on  
And the shadows will never find you  
  
Turn your face towards the sun  
Let the shadows fall behind you  
Don't look back, just carry on  
And the shadows will never find you  
  
[Verse 1]  
Lost in the rock and roll  
Got lost in a promise  
Of a love I never know  
Shadows chase me far from home  
I remember when my heart was filled with gold  
And you know  
I've been burned  
I've been burned  
I've been burned  
You've seen me lose control  
It's not worth  
It's not worth  
It's not worth  
My soul  
  
[Chorus]  
Turn your face towards the sun  
Let the shadows fall behind you  
Don't look back, just carry on  
And the shadows will never find you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Lost my faith and trust  
You and I know  
Gold don't turn to rust  
I still swear that we can reign  
Like the kings and queens of better yesterdays  
And you know  
I've been burned  
I've been burned  
I've been burned  
You've seen me lose control  
It's not worth  
It's not worth  
It's not worth  
My soul  
  
[Chorus]  
Turn your face towards the sun  
Let the shadows fall behind you  
Don't look back, just carry on  
And the shadows will never find you  
  
[Bridge]  
Where you gonna go  
Where you gonna go  
Where you gonna run to  
When you get to the edge of the night  
Its time you face the sky  
  
[Chorus]  
Turn your face towards the sun  
Let the shadows fall behind you  
Don't look back, just carry on  
And the shadows will never find you  
  
Turn your face towards the sun  
Let the shadows fall behind you  
Don't look back, just carry on  
And the shadows will never find you

"Story of my life  
Searching for the right  
But it keeps avoiding me  
Sorrow in my soul  
'Cause it seems that wrong  
Really loves my company  
  
He's more than a man  
And this is more than love  
The reason that the sky is blue  
The clouds are rolling in  
Because I'm gone again  
And to him I just can't be true  
  
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful  
And it kills him inside  
To know that I am happy with some other guy  
I can see him dying  
  
I don't wanna do this anymore  
I don't wanna be the reason why  
Every time I walk out the door  
I see him die a little more inside  
I don't wanna hurt him anymore  
I don't wanna take away his life  
I don't wanna be  
A murderer  
  
I feel it in the air  
As I'm doing my hair  
Preparing for another date  
A kiss upon my cheek  
As he reluctantly  
Asks if I'm gonna be out late  
I say I won't be long  
Just hanging with the girls  
A lie I didn't have to tell  
Because we both know  
Where I'm about to go  
And we know it very well  
  
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful  
And it kills him inside  
To know that I am happy with some other guy  
I can see him dying  
  
I don't wanna do this anymore  
I don't wanna be the reason why  
Every time I walk out the door  
I see him die a little more inside  
I don't wanna hurt him anymore  
I don't wanna take away his life  
I don't wanna be  
A murderer  
  
Our love, his trust  
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head  
Get it over with  
I don't wanna do this  
Anymore  
Uh  
Anymore  
  
And I don't wanna do this anymore  
I don't wanna be the reason why  
And every time I walk out the door  
I see him die a little more inside  
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore  
I don't wanna take away his life  
I don't wanna be  
A murderer  
A murderer  
No no no no  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Yet my heart's not so blind  
I feel so entitled of owes me  
I want what's mine  
  
And some say love ain't worth the buck  
But I'll give 'em the last dime  
To have what I've only been dreaming about  
  
Everybody wants something  
Better want something  
What are you living for?  
Everybody needs something  
Fighting for something

"Yellow diamonds in the light  
And we're standing side by side  
As your shadow crosses mine  
What it takes to come alive  
  
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny  
But I've gotta let it go  
  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
  
Shine a light through an open door  
Love and life I will divide  
Turn away 'cause I need you more  
Feel the heartbeat in my mind  
  
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny  
But I've gotta let it go  
  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
  
Yellow diamonds in the light  
And we're standing side by side  
As your shadow crosses mine  
  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place

"[Chorus]  
Ride when we ride we ride  
It's til the day we die  
When we ride we ride  
It's til the day we die  
  
It's real late  
'Bout a quarter to one  
Thinkin' about everythang  
We become  
And I hate it  
I thought we could make it  
But I'm ready to scratch this  
Just wanna forget about it  
I saw the pictures  
And the letters she sent  
You had me thinkin'  
You were out we your friends  
I'm so foolish  
Treat me like I'm stupid  
'Cause I thought it was just you and I (oh)  
  
Now I look back on the time  
That we spent and  
I see it in my mind  
Playing over and over again  
'Cause boy right now  
You got me breaking down  
And I just can't figure out why  
But this is what you say  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Visions in my mind  
Of the day that we met  
You showed me thangs  
That'll never forget  
Took me swimming  
In the ocean  
You had my head up in the clouds  
Make me feel like I'm floating (yeah)  
You think I'm playing  
When you now its the truth  
Nobody else can do it  
Quite like I do  
All my kisses  
And my lovin'  
But ain't nobody  
Better than us  
  
Now I look back on the time  
That we spent and  
I see it in my mind  
Playing over and over again  
'Cause boy right now  
You got me breaking down  
And I just can't figure out why  
But this is what you say  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
I guess its over  
And definitely  
But you and I know  
Its not that easy  
To let go  
Of everything (everything) that we planned  
And start all over again  
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it  
I won't forget how you do it  
Sweet baby  
This is where the game ends now somehow  
Might not believe you and me  
We can figure it out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You finna make me say boy  
I wish that you come hold me  
When I'm lonely  
When I need someone to talk to  
You would phone me  
Just like everything its on me  
(when we ride we ride it's til the day we die)  
Boy you forgot about the promises  
You made me  
And now we'll let the memories  
Just fade away  
But I remember  
What you used to say  
(when we ride we ride it's til the day we die)  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
We ride

"I been ignoring this big lump in my throat  
I shouldn't be crying, tears were for the weak  
The days I'm stronger, know what, so I say  
That's something missing  
  
Whatever it is, it feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-
sided mirror  
Whatever it is, it's just sitting there laughing at me  
And I just wanna scream  
  
What now? I just can't figure it out  
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out  
What now? Ohhhh what now?  
  
I found the one he changed my life  
But was it me that changed  
And he just happened to come at the right time  
I'm supposed to be in love  
But I'm not mugging  
  
Whatever it is, it feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-
sided mirror  
Whatever it is, it's just sitting there laughing at me  
And I just wanna scream  
  
What now? I just can't figure it out  
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out  
What now? Please tell me  
What now?  
  
There's no one to call cause I'm just playing games with them all  
The more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone  
'Cause I spent every hour just going through the motions  
I cant even get the emotions to come out  
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout  
  
What now? I just can't figure it out  
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out  
What now? Somebody tell me  
What now?  
  
I don't know where to go  
I don't know what to feel  
I don't know how to cry  
I don't know ow ow why  
I don't know where to go  
I don't know what to feel  
I don't know how to cry

"[Verse 1]  
Nothing but a tear, that's all for breakfast  
Watching you pretend you're unaffected  
You're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go  
But I won't  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
No you don't need my protection  
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking  
I look in your direction, hoping that the message goes  
  
[Chorus]  
Somewhere close to you  
Close to you  
Like so close if they heard you, you wouldn't find out  
Just say now, I'm coming right now, to be close to you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Said you let it go, you kept it  
Working hard to perfect it  
Now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control  
Would you let it go?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
No you don't need my protection  
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking  
I look in your direction, hoping that the message goes  
  
[Chorus]  
Somewhere close to you  
Close to you  
Like so close if they heard you, you wouldn't find out  
If you let me, I'd be there by now  
Close to you

"Looking back it's hard for me to see  
Just how I could have been so blind  
Like an actor on a movie screen  
You played the part with every line  
Well every story doesn't have a happy ending  
Sometimes a flower doesn't grow  
  
I hope you understand the message that I'm sending  
But boy I think you need to know  
  
(Coulda been the one)  
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall boo  
(Shoulda been the one)  
Didn't know just what you had boy  
Now it's just too bad boy  
(After all is said and done)  
You're a cheater and a liar  
Went to play with fire  
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun  
'cause you coulda been the one  
  
There's nothing left to say  
Coulda been the one  
Coulda been  
Shoulda been  
  
My momma didn't raise no fool  
She said play with fire you get burned  
You laughed at me, I laugh at you  
Now it seems the table's turned  
I must admit I really thought you had potential  
But I could not have been more wrong  
I need somebody I can trust with his essentials  
You had your chance but now I'm long gone  
  
(Coulda been the one)  
I would give it all to catch you when you fall boo  
(Shoulda been the one)  
Didn't know just what you had boy  
Now it's just too bad boy

(You coulda been the one)  
Oh yeah  
  
You played yourself boy  
And there is no denying it  
It's just the way the story goes  
You made your bed boy  
Better go and lay in it  
But know that you'll be laying there alone  
  
You coulda been the one

Underdogs dance in the middle of the night  
Can see the night skies in the mirror of your eyes  
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm  
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm  
I wanna run wild in the middle of the night  
Right under the moon, bodies glowing in the night  
Nothing in between our skins but the rhythm  
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm  
The night-time is the right time  
  
[Chorus x2]  
I wanna dance in the dark and never stop  
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars  
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed  
Move move move  
Dancing in the dark

Underdogs dance in the middle of the night  
Out here with the stars like the creatures of the night  
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm  
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm  
I wanna dance fast in the middle of the night  
And see the night skies in the mirror of your eyes  
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm  
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm  
The night-time is the right time

"That's how much I love you  
That's how much I need you  
And I can't stand you  
Must everything you do make me wanna smile  
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)  
  
But you won't let me  
You upset me, girl  
And then you kiss my lips  
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)  
Can't remember what you did  
  
(But I hate it) You know exactly what to do  
So that I can't stay mad at you  
For too long, that's wrong  
  
(But I hate it) You know exactly how to touch  
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more  
Said I despise that I adore you  
  
And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah)  
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)  
And I hate how much I love you, boy (ooh, whoa)  
But I just can't let you go  
And I hate that I love you so (ooh)  
  
And you completely know the power that you have (the power that you have)  
The only one makes me laugh (one that makes you laugh)  
  
Sad, and it's not fair  
How you take advantage of the fact  
That I love you beyond a reason why  
And it just ain't right  
  
And I hate how much I love you, girl  
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah)  
And I hate how much I love you, girl  
But I just can't let you go  
But I hate that I love you so  
  
One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me  
And your kiss won't make me weak  
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me  
So you'll probably always have a spell on me  
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
That's how much I love you (how much I need you)  
That's how much I need you (how much I love you)  
That's how much I love you (Oh, need you)  
That's how much I need you (I need you)  
  
And I hate that I love you so  
And I hate how much I love you, boy  
I can't stand how much I need ya (I can't stand how much I need you)  
And I hate how much I love you, boy  
But I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go, no)

"[Verse]  
This whiskey got me feelin' pretty  
So pardon if I'm impolite  
I just really need your ass with me  
I'm sorry 'bout the other night  
And I know I could be more creative  
And come up with poetic lines  
But I'm turnt up off sizz' and \"I love you\"  
Is the only thing that's in my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
You take me higher, higher than I've ever been, babe  
Just come over, let's pour a drink, babe  
I hope I ain't calling you too late, too late  
You light my fire  
Let's stay up late and smoke a J  
I wanna go back to the old ways  
But I'm drunk and still with a full ash tray  
With a little bit too much to say

"Mmm, mmm, ohh, no, oh, no

Amazing, mistakes all night and day  
Makes my temperature rise  
Boy your love has got me so hypnotized  
I'm feeling something that I can't understand  
It's like I'm captured by the touch of your hand  
Its survive, it's your style, it's the way that you smile  
Get a little rush when I hear your name  
It's so magnetic when you're here next to me  
Hold me closer, happens so naturally  
We connect, it's electric, this feeling inside  
Didn't know that even if I tried  
Something 'bout the way that you working me

Never had a feeling like this before  
Something 'bout the way that you working me  
Teasing me, pleasing me easily, boy

"Another day another reminder that your not here with me,  
I watch the snowflakes falling from the sky then I get lost in memories,  
The time we tried to build a snowman, the time we tried to count the stars,  
Its crazy how we didn't know that wed ever be apart,  
  
Chorus  
I can hear the music playing,  
See the lights upon the tree,  
I can feel the joy in every soul,  
But for me it's incomplete,  
And I try my best to play the part,  
But no matter what I do,  
No it just don't feel like Christmas, without you.  
  
Another tear, another regret boy, that your so far away,  
Can it be, that it was only last year we shared that Christmas day?  
Remember when we took the sleigh ride, remember singing by the fire?  
There's to much that's in the daylight, I keep reliving you and I.  
  
Chorus  
  
Time to try to build a snowman, the time we try to count the stars,  
Its crazy how we didn't know that wed ever be apart!

I can feel the joy in every soul, but for me it's incomplete,  
And I try my best to play the part  
But no matter what I do,  
No it just don't feel like Christmas, no it just don't feel like Christmas,
without you.  
  
See I tried but it jut aint right, without you.

"Wait  
You ain't even thinking what you say  
Your words leave me frozen like a lake  
And dropped under the surface  
You killing out  
The one thing  
That gives us purpose  
  
Stop  
Take a look at love  
You'll never know  
'Cause I'm not gonna let you  
Leave me feeling cold  
So don't you come here  
There'll be no more tears  
In this atmosphere  
  
All that I asked for  
Is love that  
Don't hurt soul  
Why did you come here?  
Tell me  
Why did you come here?  
  
Own invited  
I don't know  
Why you felt like  
You could try to come  
Within' a hundred miles  
I'm a fighter  
But I don't want  
To fight the cold  
And every damn time  
That you come close  
  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I don't know  
What you came here for  
Got me frozen like an icicle  
  
My whole world turns to ice  
My whole world turns to ice  
My whole world turns to  
  
You  
Don't understand  
The way of  
What you do  
But I made it through  
The other side  
I'm through  
And I took this hard  
And you can see me speaking  
From a dead cold start  
  
All that I asked for  
Is love that  
Don't hurt soul  
So why did you come here?  
Tell me  
Why did you come here?

What you came here for  
Got me frozen like an icicle  
  
My whole world turns to ice  
My whole world turns to ice  
My whole world turns to  
  
I  
Can hold my head up high  
As frost covers the ground  
And I can see sunlight  
Through these clouds  
  
Yeeah  
Yeeeeah  
  
Own invited  
I don't know  
Why you felt like  
You could try to come  
Within' a hundred miles

To fight the cold  
And every damn time

Got me frozen like an icicle

I'm frozen like an icicle  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I don't know  
What you came here for  
Got me frozen like an icicle

"Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away  
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway.  
It makes you burn to learn, you're not the only one  
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun.  
  
Now you've gone somewhere else, far away  
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you).  
But you feel my breath, on your neck  
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you).  
  
'Cause you keep me coming back for more  
And I feel a little better than I did before  
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind  
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight  
  
Sometimes you move so well  
It's hard not to give in.  
  
I'm lost, I can't tell  
Where you end and I begin.  
  
It makes you burn to learn  
I'm with another man.  
  
I wonder if he's half  
The lover that I am.  
  
Now you've gone somewhere else, Far away  
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you).  
But you feel my breath, On your neck  
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you).  
  
'Cause you keep me coming back for more  
And I feel a little better than I did before  
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind

Baby, baby, please believe me  
Find it in your heart to reach me  
Promise not to leave me behind  
(Promise not to leave me behind)  
  
Take me down, but take it easy  
Make me think but don't deceive me  
Torture me by taking your time  
(Talk to me, talk to me)  
  
'Cause you keep me coming back for more  
And I feel a little better than I did before  
  
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind  
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight

And I feel a little better than I did before  
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind

"Kisses don't  
No they don't  
Never don't lie  
You can run if you want but you cant hide  
Tellin' you its the truth don't you ask why  
Kisses don't  
No they don't  
Kisses don't lie  
  
Emotions come and go  
Almost how the wind will blow  
There so little in this world to trust in  
Seduce themselves with lies  
Some don't realize  
They call it love but its really only lustin'  
  
So you see you and me  
We're gettin' close to the danger zone  
Show me how tell me now  
Should I stay or should I go  
Cause I'm caught between yes and no  
  
Cause when you kiss me  
I feel everything that I been missing  
I try to slow down but my heart wont listen  
And its tearin' me all up inside  
And when you touch me  
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me  
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in  
I try to run but there's no place to hide  
Cause baby kisses don't lie  
  
Kisses don't  
No they don't  
Never don't lie  
You can run if you want but you cant hide  
Tellin' you its the truth don't you ask why  
Kisses don't  
No they don't  
Kisses don't lie  
  
You whisper in my ear  
But are your words sincere  
Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife  
You see I'm nobody's fool  
I play by my own rules  
So please think twice before you step into my life  
  
So you see you and me  
We're gettin close to the danger zone  
Show me how tell me now  
Should I stay or should I go  
Cause I'm caught between yes and no  
  
Cause when you kiss me  
I feel everything that I been missing  
I try to slow down but my heart wont listen  
And its tearin' me all up inside  
And when you touch me  
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me  
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in  
I try to run but there's no place to hide  
Cause baby kisses don't lie  
  
Cause when you kiss me  
I feel everything that I been missing  
I try to slow down but my heart wont listen  
And its tearin' me all up inside  
And when you touch me  
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me  
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in  
I try to run but there's no place to hide  
Cause baby kisses don't lie  
  
Emotions come and go  
Almost how the wind will blow  
There so little in this world to trust in  
Seduce themselves with lies  
Some don't realize  
They call it love but its really only lustin'  
  
Cause when you kiss me  
I feel everything that I been missing  
I try to slow down but my heart wont listen  
And its tearin' me all up inside  
And when you touch me  
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me  
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in  
I try to run but there's no place to hide  
Cause baby kisses don't lie

"You can't lease my love x9  
Oh, this was just an empty space  
That both we tried to live  
With windows and a can of paint  
And we began to build  
  
In spite of that  
(Try to build it up x3)  
In spite of this  
(Try to build it up x3)  
  
I have felt such an imbalance  
Loved my way around it  
And everyone around believed  
That one of us was in it for the profit  
(For the profit, for the profit)  
Just for the profit  
  
Now we're months behind the rent  
Every dollar gone unspent  
Getting closer to the end  
It all depends  
  
If you would break from me  
Break from me  
Break away from me  
You tried to lease my love  
Lease my love, lease my love  
But you can't cheat my love  
Go on and lease my love  
  
Lease my love, lease my love  
You can't cheat my love  
I knew this day will come,  
It came so very quick  
I knew that once we fell apart  
No rule will ever stick  
And we would fold the profit  
(Fold the profit x5)  
  
Now we're months behind the rent  
Every dollar gone unspent  
Getting closer to the end  
It all depends  
  
If you would break from me

"[chorus:]  
I got a house, but I need new furniture  
Why spend mine when I could spend yours?  
The truth is I will love you the same  
But why complain when you buying gucci, babe?  
  
You might see me in the spot  
Ya boy think I'm hot  
So I came up in here to get what you got  
I'm hot like the block  
Uh huh, you like that  
Know you wanna bite that  
Uh huh, yeah, right there  
They love the young girl  
They wanna give it to me  
Wish I was in a flick  
And I ain't talking movies  
If ya young, if ya hot, girl  
Shake what ya got, girl  
I keep 'em singing...  
  
[Bridge:]  
(Lemme get that, huh)  
(What you got up in them jeans? Put it on me, or get lonely)  
Lemme get that (huh)  
(You know, five-car garages, name on your bank account, all day massages)  
(Lemme hit that, huh)  
(I wanna put it on blast)  
(Lemme get that, huh)  
Better slow down 'for I make you crash, boy  
Got what you want, baby, got what you need  
But we can't proceed  
Unless you got that for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a put you on the spot  
Keep the sheet in knots  
I bought me a Benz  
You buy me the yacht  
A girl need a lot  
The girl need some stocks  
Bonds is what I got, bonds is what I got (Ya get it?)  
They love the young girl  
They wanna give it to me  
Wish I was in a flick  
And I ain't talking movies  
If ya young, if ya hot, girl  
Shake what ya got, girl  
I keep 'em singing...

Oh, oh, oh  
Boy, I know you want my love  
Oh, oh, oh  
Nothing is free in this world  
Oh, oh, oh  
Unless my love is your love  
Oh, oh, oh  
I'm not a gold digger

"What am I supposed to do with this heart  
How do I take it off, if the love ain't on, it's like a work of art  
In love we all will fall but, we fell a little harder  
What am I supposed to do with this heart  
  
It may be wrong but it feels right, to be lost in paradise  
  
I'm so lost in paradise  
If I open up my eyes  
I can see the storm, I can see the sky  
I can see the darkness flashing lights  
All my fears, don't deny  
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise  
  
How was I to know that my love was delusional  
Somebody tell me how to mend a broken-hearted soul  
In love we all will fall but, we fell a little harder  
What am I supposed to do with this heart  
  
It may be wrong but it feels right, to be lost in paradise  
  
I'm so lost in paradise  
If I open up my eyes  
I can see the storm, I can see the sky  
I can see the darkness flashing lights  
All my fears, don't deny  
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise  
  
It may be wrong but it feels right  
All my fears are gone tonight  
I'm lost in paradise  
  
I'm so lost in paradise  
If I open up my eyes  
I can see the storm, I can see the sky  
I can see the darkness flashing lights  
All my fears, don't deny  
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise  
  
Lost in paradise  
Yeah, lost in paradise  
Lost in paradise

"Took a chance, rolled the dice on me and you  
Opened up, let you in my world  
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control  
Swept away, so proud to be your girl  
But when you write a story much to fast  
Sometimes a happy ending doesn't last  
  
[Chorus]  
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a plaything  
Now I know it's not an ordinary everyday thing  
Now I know that when this ride is so amazing  
When it's wrong you gotta let it go  
Now I know  
Now I know  
  
Remember when, we said our love would last forever  
But then again, how are we to know  
There come a time, that love will change like stormy weather  
A sunny day can suddenly turn cold  
Time will teach you all you need to learn  
But there'll always be a first time you get burned  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't regret a single day  
The joy and pain along the way  
A broken heart's the price we pay  
As sad as it may seem  
Baby can't you see  
It's the way it's gotta be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah  
Now I know  
I know

"Here's a little story I gotta tell  
'Bout this boy I know so well  
Back in the day was cool and all  
He fell in love, I fell in love  
I thought he was the one for me  
Other boys I could not see  
And look what happened to our love  
I'm like how could it be  
  
It shoulda been me and you  
It coulda been you and me  
But boy you broke my heart  
And now I'm standing there  
It shoulda been me and you  
It coulda been you and me  
  
Now all I got are these photographs  
All I've got  
All I've got  
All I've got  
Are these photographs  
All I've got  
All I've got  
  
Its nothing without you, you, you  
Got nothing without you, you, you  
Got nothing without you  
  
Now baby its killing me  
I'm saying its killing me  
The fact that you ain't around  
Baby, I'm falling down  
I need me a remedy  
Been looking for remedies  
I need you to be around  
Baby I'm hurting now  
I know you're a better man (when I was your girl)  
This land is a better land (when you're in my world)  
  
Today will be better, babe  
If it were like yesterday, so happy and lovely  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
All I've got  
All I've got  
All I've got  
Are these photographs  
All I've got  
All I've got  
  
Its nothing without you, you, you  
Got nothing without you, you, you  
Got nothing without you  
  
All I've got are these photographs  
I remember when I used to make you laugh  
I don't wanna be stuck in the past  
But you're all that I have that I had  
And I don't wanna lose what we've felt this far  
This is me and you, you're my superstar  
I'll give anything baby, here's my heart  
My heart, my heart  
  
My heart don't stop  
My heart be beating over  
My loving never stops  
Even though that it's over  
Girl I been reminiscing  
With that way that Casanova  
Way back when we was kissing on your grand momma's sofa  
Girl I got us lovey dubby on my photo album  
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein  
You had your Guess jeans on  
Looking sexy on home?  
Girl why couldn't I be the one?  
  
Why, why, why  
Why couldn't I be the one?  
(Why, why, why)  
Why couldn't you be the one?  
(Why, why, why)  
Why couldn't you be the one?  
(Why, why, why)  
  
All I've got  
All I've got  
Its nothing without you  
All I've got  
All I've got  
Its nothing without you, you, you  
Its nothing without you, you, you  
Its nothing without you  
All I've got  
Its nothing without  
All I've got  
Its nothing without  
All I've got  
All I've got are these photographs

"Just a thought  
To add suspense  
To all the games  
Of discontent.  
  
Fear is real  
But not self-taught  
You let others  
Be the cause.  
  
There we go racing towards the sun,  
Ignoring all the noise,  
Striving for the grace of man.  
People play this great charade,  
And always miss the point.  
Never fall for prophecies.  
  
You say it draws near,  
That it will be clear.  
You act so convinced,  
A fortress you've built.  
Remember the doubt  
By which I now stand.  
You write the book  
On the way it all ends.  
  
Tear down  
Those mighty walls.  
Reinvent  
The way you talk.  
  
Look ahead,  
Now down below,  
Or high above,  
Where angels flow.There we go racing towards the sun,  
Ignoring all the noise,  
Striving for the grace of man.  
People play this great charade,  
And always miss the point.  
Never fall for prophecies.  
  
Waiting to see  
Our kind disagree.  
You draw the line  
And stick to your pride.  
Remember the doubt  
By which I now stand.  
You write the book  
On the way...  
  
It ends.

You say it draws near  
That it will be clear.  
You act so convinced,  
A fortress you've built.  
Remember the doubt  
By which I now stand.  
You wrote the book  
On the way it all ends.  
  
It ends.

"What's up?  
I know we haven't spoken for a while  
But I was thinkin' bout you  
And it kinda made me smile  
So many things to say  
And I'll put em in a letter  
And thought it might be easier  
The words might come out better  
How's your mother, how's your little brother?  
Does he still look just like you?  
So many things I wanna know the answers to  
Wish I could press rewind  
And rewrite every line  
To the story of me and you  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried  
To get you out my mind  
But it don't get no better  
As each day goes by  
And I'm lost and confused  
I've got nothin' to lose  
Hope to hear from you soon  
P.S. I'm still not over you  
Still not over you  
  
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on  
But there's a lot of feelings that remain since you've gone  
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me  
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me  
Like a silly joke, or somethin' on the t.v.  
Boy it ain't easy  
When I hear our song  
I get that same old feeling  
Wish I could press rewind  
Turn back the hands of time  
And I shouldn't be telling you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Did you know I kept all of your pictures  
Don't have the strength to part with them yet  
Oh no  
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste  
But some things a girl can never forget

Nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious  
'Cause the beat gonna chase my body  
Shakin' aside my bones  
And you pushin' all my buttons, takin' me outta my zone  
Yeah

Come up to my room you sexy little thing  
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease

You wanna come get me outta my dress

Your fingertips leave me hypnotized

"Take off my shirt, loosen the buttons and undo my skirt  
Stare at myself in the mirror  
Take me apart, piece by piece  
Sorrow decrease, pressure release  
I put in work  
Did more than called upon, more than deserved  
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)  
But it taught me before a decision ask this question first:

Who am I living for?  
Is this my limit, can I endure some more?  
Chances are given, question existing  
Who am I living for?  
Is this my limit, can I endure some more?  
Chances are given, question existing  
  
Take off my cool  
Show them that under here I'm just like you  
Do the mistakes I've made make me a fool  
Or a human with flaws?  
Admit that I'm lost, round of applause  
Take the abuse  
Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose  
It's entertainment, is that an excuse? (No)  
But the question that lingers whether win or lose:  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dear diary  
It's Robyn  
Entertaining is something I do for a living  
It's not who I am  
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal  
I laugh, I get mad, I hurt, I think I suck sometimes  
But when you're in the spotlight, everything seems good  
(Ooo, yeah)  
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst 'cause I have to always keep my guard up  
I don't know who to trust, I don't know who wants to date me for who I am  
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am  
  
[Chorus]

"
"There could be a freak accident  
There could be a fatal disease  
I know we hate to think about it  
But this as real as you and me  
This as real as you and me  
  
We could all fall down  
Before our Saviour could return  
I know we hate to think about it  
But it's as real as you and me  
  
If I should go  
Hold my hand  
If I should leave  
Darling cover me, please  
  
The earth could quake to ruin  
We could drift off in our sleep  
I know we hate to think about it  
But this as real as you and me  
This as real as you and me  
  
The ocean crushed the shore  
And take us down forevermore  
I know we hate to think about it  
But this as real as you and me  
  
If I should go  
Hold my hand  
If I should leave  
Darling cover me, please  
  
I know we hate to think about it  
But it's as real as you and me  
It's as real as you and me

"Baby, baby  
When we first met, I never felt something so strong  
You were like my lover and my best friend  
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it  
And all of a sudden you went and left  
I didn't know how to follow  
It's like a shock that spun me around  
And now my heart's dead  
I feel so empty and hollow  
  
And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you  
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?  
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back  
And you're the one to blame  
And now I feel like  
  
Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking  
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more  
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking  
I should've never let you enter my door  
Next time you wanna go on and leave  
I should just let you go on and do it  
Cause now I'm using like I bleed  
  
[Chorus]  
It's like I checked into rehab  
And, baby, you're my disease  
It's like I checked into rehab  
And, baby, you're my disease  
I gotta check into rehab  
Cause, baby, you're my disease  
I gotta check into rehab  
Cause, baby, you're my disease  
  
Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?  
You'd do anything for the one you love  
Cause anytime that you needed me I'd be there  
It's like you were my favorite drug  
The only problem is that you was using me  
In a different way than I was using you  
But now that I know it's not meant to be  
It gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you  
  
And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you  
You don't even recognize the way you hurt me, do you?  
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back  
And you're the one to blame  
Cause now I feel like

And you cant find your way back home  
When your world falls apart  
And you're lost in the dark  
And you know that your all alone  
When you just can deal, and you need something real  
Someone that'll always come through  
Who ya gonna run to?  
Who ya gonna run to?  
  
You and me we go back to jump rope and grade school  
Memories when you were tryin' so hard to play cool  
I don't mind I know that you gotta go through your changes  
Take your time sometimes are hard to rearrange it  
  
As long as we've been together  
You've always been the one  
Nobody knows you better

And you're loosin' your grip  
And you cant find your way back home  
When your world falls apart  
And you're lost in the dark  
And you know that your all alone  
When you just can deal, and you need something real  
Someone that'll always come through  
Who ya gonna run to?

There ain't nobody who can ever understand like I do ( I do)  
So when you realize you need the one you said goodbye to (bye to)  
Look over your shoulder boy and you know who be there  
  
You know I'm gonna be right there (right there)  
  
When your friends start to trip  
And your loosin' your grip  
And u cant find your way back home  
When your world falls apart  
And you're lost in the dark  
And you know that your all alone  
When you just can deal, and you need something real  
Someone that'll always come through

And you find all the haters around you, they don't mean nothing

To keep me from burning (burning oh)  
Don't want to drift away  
Floating in outer space  
There's no way I'm returning oh  
  
And our love is written in the stars  
Already written in the stars  
If I'm from Venus you're from Mars  
Our love is written in the stars  
  
And our love is written in the stars  
Already written in the stars  
If I'm from Venus you're from Mars  
Our love is written in the stars  
  
Oh, oh, eh, eh, eh, It's written in the stars  
Oh, oh, eh, eh, it's written in the stars

"[Chorus]  
No no no  
You don't love me and I know now  
No no no  
You don't love me so let me go now  
(I can't let you go, can't let you go)  
If you ask me, baby  
I should've left you a long time ago, no  
  
Playas gonna play  
At least thats what they say  
Well I know that for myself now  
(You know I love you)  
You said you loved me babe  
Then you played your game  
A game that I know all too well now  
Well I used to buy your lines  
But it's time for me to sail now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
First you tellin me no  
But please tell me yes  
Without some of this stress  
Straight up tell me yes  
Gimme the keys to ya chest  
Ya chest will rise neva rest  
As ya chest you got me feelin like i'm climbin on Mount Everest  
Hey Rihanna  
Your lovin really put me to the test  
But if you shoulda let me soon the answer will yes  
Yes to this yes to that yes to whateva you suggest  
So please say yes  
No no no  
  
[Verse 2]  
  
Haters gonna hate  
(Let them hate)  
I found out much to late  
I think I know we're a little hot now  
The truth leads to the lies  
The heart ain't always right  
And I see that love is blind now  
Boy you use to have my trust  
Without no trust there ain't no us boy  
  
[Chorus]
