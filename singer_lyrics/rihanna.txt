"As I was walkin' down the road to Bethlehem one night
I looked up to the sky and there I saw a wondrous sight
A star was shining brighter than I'd ever seen before
And a host of angels sang to me, never heard a song so pure
They said don't be afraid, we bring good news to all the world
With great tidings of joy for every boy and every girl

[Chorus:]
A child is born
On this holy night
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
So come to see
Mary's sweet baby
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully
Oh yeah

As I went down into the town to see what I could see
Three mighty kings with golden rings came ridin' up to me
They said they seek the child who was born beneath the star
Of all the kings this one would be the mightiest by far
So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come
And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone

[Chorus:]
A child is born
On this holy night
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
So come to see
Mary's sweet baby
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully
Hallelujah (repeated)

So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come
And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone

[Chorus:]
A child is born
On this holy night
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
So come to see
Mary's sweet baby
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully
Oh yeah

"Some girls play the game
They all walk and talk
And they dress the same
Nothin' new to say
Don't they realize
That it's so easy to see
Right though there disguise
Makes me wonder why
When the whole worlds turnin' left
It's when I'm goin' right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside

Cause a girl like me
Is just a lil' different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never settles for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me

Possibility
Got me trippin'
Thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me
Still I need to know
Should I keep this feelin'
Or let it go
I can't wait no more
So now's the time
To speak your mind
And show me what you feel
So tell me if you
Want to take a chance
On something real

Cause a girl like me
Is just a lil' different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never settles for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me

Mirror mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the answer here tonight
Mirror mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the answer here tonight

When the whole world's turnin' left
It's when I'm going right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside

Cause a girl like me
Is just a lil' different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never settles for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me

"Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my finger
It seems like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king
My California king

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king

"On my roof (roof, roof, roof)
Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof (proof, proof, proof)
I'm torn apart and you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold case love (love, love)
And I let you reach me one more time
But that's enough

Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall
Truth was there all along
Tell me how did we miss it

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes
Couldn't see, no
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind you can keep
Release me now cause I did my time
Of this cold case love
My heart's no longer cold and confined
I've had enough

Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall
Truth was there all along
Tell me how did we miss it

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

We lost our way
Took this too far
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart
We've lost enough
Looking for a truth
That was here all along

Cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

We opened up a cold case love
It got the best of us
Now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love, love

"
"Ooh yeah
Yeah yea

When you stand so close to me
I'm feeling butterflies
Is this the way that it supposed to be
When I look into your eyes
All you have to do is say my name
Just a stutter more like butter
Since I met you boy my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this
